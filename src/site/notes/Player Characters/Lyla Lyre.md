Lyla Lyre is a [[List of Player Characters\|Player Character]] from the Dinner Party One Shot played by Bonny. She is a Halfling Bard-barian, and former Enforcer for Peitry Destrilus. 

After working with Peitry for two decades, Lyla decided it was finally about time to chase her dreams of becoming a famous musician. She took the money that she had saved up over the years, told him she was leaving, and had enrolled in a prestigious Bard College in Tithapst by the end of the week.

A few years later, Lyla Lyre is now a popular musician around the kingdom and beyond. She has enjoyed residencies in every city, and is eyeing up an international tour in the near future. Just as her career was about to be catapulted, she received an invite to a party hosted by Peitry, as well as a request to play for the aristocracy that would be present. With a great opportunity to get her name in richer circles, and a seeming warm invite from an old friend, she took Peitry up on his offer, and attended the party.

Unfortunately, Peitry's intentions were leaning more in the direction of revenge, as he was furious at her leaving his team. His spite drove him to subdue her and hold her in a stone chamber beneath the party, until she broke out, and chaos ensued.

Following the party, Lyra has attempted to return to her usual schedule of touring, but her old ways, and tendency towards anger has started to bubble up again
