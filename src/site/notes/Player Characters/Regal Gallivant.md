Regal Gallivant was a [[List of Player Characters\|Player Character]] in the Dinner Party One Shot played by Jay. She was a Tiefling Rogue with an Echo; collectively functioning as a member of The Red Right Hand, and the perpetrator of the assassination of Emperor Yalte of Tal'Eraie.

As a child, Regal found herself separated from her parents and lost in the Great Green, unknowingly stumbling into a Fey circle and encountering The Green Prince. Initially furious at the intrusion, but seeing how scared the girl was, he took pity on her, and helped her "make a friend", by granting her the ability to form an Echo of herself, which became her closest friend and confidante.

Over time this ability caught the attention of several groups and individuals, including the aforementioned Red Right Hand, who taught her how to effectively utilise her Echo to carry out hits, leading to her becoming one of the most prolific assassins in the history of the guild, including her legendary hit on Emperor Yalte of Tal'Eraie. In the process, she was branded by a bolt from [[Player Characters/Qiyax's Eberoth\|Qiyax's Eberoth]], Head of the Royal Guard. 

Upon returning home, she was told her next hit was on [[Player Characters/Vanston Chixtabar\|Vanston Chixtabar]], and that she would find him at a dinner party in the house of Peitry Destrilus. Regal attended the party, but was accosted by Qiyax's, managing to buy herself the time to slip away. 

After the party had ended in disaster, Regal attempted to kill Vanston, but was bested in combat, finally being taken out by Qiyax's, leaving her Echo alone in the world for the first time.
