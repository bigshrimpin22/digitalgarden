Enzo Ferratus was one of the [[List of Player Characters\|Player Characters]] in the Vignettes campaign, played by Declan. He was a young Human [[Class Lore/Paladin\|Paladin]] from Greybird Keep, and was the son of Arturo Ferratus, a local Artificer. His mother and brother died during a bandit attack while he was incredibly young, and his older sister ran away to a circus 2 years before the beginning of the campaign.

Enzo lost his mother and brother at a young age, and from that point, his father knew that getting them back would become his life's goal. He passed this desire on to his son, and Enzo grew up knowing he would become a hero, not just to his family, but to others.

From as soon as he was able to walk and talk, Enzo was told by his father that he would embark on a quest once he reached adulthood. A quest that would bring his mother and brother back, and reunite the family as one. 

Enzo embarked on this quest soon after the arrival of his eighteenth birthday, venturing into the wilds of Kitoah, until he found the cave he had been planning to explore for over a decade. Unfortunately, during his planning with Arturo, something had gone horribly wrong, and a miscalculation had been made that led to Enzo being blasted with the full force of the cave's magical radiation.

Enzo managed to retrieve the gem he was searching for, but collapsed at the mouth of the cave. A group of bandits happened upon him and decided to rob him and put him out of his misery. In his final moments, Enzo was able to take down one of the bandits
