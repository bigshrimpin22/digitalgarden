Vanston Chixtabar is a [[List of Player Characters\|Player Character]] from the Dinner Party One Shot played by Gavin. He is as Dragonborn Paladin and the most famous hero in [[Kitoah\|Kitoah]]. 

The only survivor of an ambush on his village’s convoy by gnolls, a young Vanston swore to never allow anyone to suffer the fear and pain he did on that day. From that day, his oath drove him, becoming stronger, confronting injustice and strife, leading him to become a hero to everyone in the kingdom. He has occasionally led armies into battle against foes he thinks are particularly villainous, but prefers to keep to private affairs. He has put out fires, retrieved precious artefacts for religious groups, and even gotten in some romantic entanglements along the way. But the road to conquest is a lonely one, and he marches alone to this day.

Vanston is no stranger to high society and parties like the one Peitry invited him to. Unlike any other party, he received a warning from a courier, stating that someone at the party wished to take his life. As well as this, Peitry had told him that he has a “proposition” to make. While he would never run from a fight, Vanston is not an idiot. He attended the party disguised as Major Basil Bortram, a high ranking Tortle from the neighbouring kingdom’s military, intending to stay out of harm's way and hear out Peitry. 

Vanston turned down Peitry's offer to take up arms in his name. After the battle, [[Player Characters/Regal Gallivant\|Regal Gallivant]], the assassin who had been sent to take care of Vanston confronted him, but he defeated her swiftly, leading to her death and leaving her Echo alone for the first time.

Following the events at the dinner party, Vanston has not been seen in public
