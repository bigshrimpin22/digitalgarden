Bo Cleraft is a Player Character from the Dinner Party One Shot played by Declan. They are a Firbolg Wizard, and current acting principal of The Spindle, the oldest and only officially recognised school of magic in [[Kitoah\|Kitoah]]. 

They attended the dinner party at Peitry Destrilus's in hopes of securing a sponsorship for the school, as they wanted some funding to look into creating more secure magical defenses for the kingdom. They were equipped with some information about Peitry's less savoury doings, and planned on blackmailing him if worst came to worst.

The information they had referred to Peitry's ring of "Enforcers" that he hired out to people as thugs to intimidate and bully people. They also had their own suspicions about his involvement in an art thieving ring, but wanted to stick to the facts.
