When Yalte was alive, Qiyax's served as head of the royal guard and military, unable to keep order in his absence, he has turned to hunting down the person he saw on the rooftop that night, marked with his Brand of Castigation, ([[Player Characters/Regal Gallivant\|Regal Gallivant]]).

On his journey to find the assassin, he ended up at the home of Peitry Destrilus, a man he recognises as having had dealings with the Emperor previously. Through the course of the night, he managed to locate and take down Regal, seemingly avenging his emperor and returning to his home a hero, not realising that it was Regal's Echo who had killed Yalte.
