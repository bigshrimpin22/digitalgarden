Babara Waddell is a Player Character from the Dinner Party One Shot played by Dan. She is a Halfling Warlock and serves The Green Prince.

After the divorce 5 years ago Babara thought she had lost everything, and she kind of had. Her children didn’t want to be around her anymore, her friends stopped calling, she eventually just stopped going to work or leaving the house at all.

On a whim, she answered the door to a knock one night. The wizened man at the door asked for a favour, just for her to fetch him some water. Upon her return he poured it over his own head, and sprouted, to reveal the most gorgeous creature Babara had laid eyes upon. The Green Prince rewarded her for her kindness, and was taken aback when she asked if he needed any more favours done.

Since that night, the Prince has occasionally sent her a place, a time, and brief instructions. Every time she has delivered, and been rightly rewarded. Her newest mission was to find the Staff of the Feywild in a big mansion that just so happens to be hosting a large to-do. She had never had a job to do around so many people before, but the thought of her Prince spurred her on, as well as the thought doing some “shopping” for herself while she looked for the staff. 

Once combat had broken out in the mansion, Babara grabbed the staff and fled into the night, delighted to complete another mission for her love
