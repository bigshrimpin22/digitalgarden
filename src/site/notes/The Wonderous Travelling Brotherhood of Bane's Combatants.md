TWTBBC is a group of Paladins that follow the teachings of Bane in a very direct manner. Being a blend of the old-school and new-age teachings of the elder of the brother gods, they are a group of professional wrestlers that adore both the act of combat and the flamboyant theatrics that come with it. They originally hail from Sandurug, but are currently touring Kitoah in their off-season to make some extra cash where they can

They were encountered by the party on the way to Aesend in [[Session Reports/Main Campaign/Main Campaign Session 2\|Main Campaign Session 2]], and later again in [[Session Reports/Main Campaign/Main Campaign Session 7\|Main Campaign Session 7]], back in Aegirstead.

Its members at present consist of:
Vulful the Destroyer - Half-orc man and leader, Dark hair in a ponytail and one chipped tusk
Astericus the Mountain - Warforged, Tall and broad, coppery and uses their chest as a gong when combat is taking place
Graal, the Magnificent - Elven man, chestnut brown buzzcut and quite tall for an elf. He has been diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis by Charles in Session 2, but was later cured by him in Session 7
Flork - Goblin, scrawny and bald
Fulfhea the Wolf - Human, close cropped blonde hair, hardened physique and several scars along her arms
