Some states and territories track time in different ways. As Kitoah is the main focus of my campaigns (for now) this timeline will use the Kitoahn tracking method.
- Kitoahn: AT - Ante Treaty, years before the signing of the treaty; CT - Calvadas Treaty, years after the signing of the treaty
- Tal'Eraie: BE - Before Empire, years before the commencement of the empire EY - Years since the creation of the empire
