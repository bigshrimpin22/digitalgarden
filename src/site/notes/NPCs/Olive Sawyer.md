Olive Sawyer is a middle-aged human woman, wife of [[NPCs/Orvyn Sawyer\|Orvyn Sawyer]], and mother of Dottie. She is afflicted with Lycanthropy.

While she was pregnant with Dottie, Olive was bitten by a wild dog in the woods, which incubated in her system and led to her first transformation into a werewolf 5 years later. It also resulted in her daughter being afflicted with lycanthropy, however Dottie appears to maintain some degree of control over her transformations.

Following the trauma of watching herself attack and kill people she knew, Olive has become practically mute, not eating unless absolutely necessary, and locking herself away every full moon to protect everyone around her. She fears herself, and fears being held responsible for what happened all those years ago.
