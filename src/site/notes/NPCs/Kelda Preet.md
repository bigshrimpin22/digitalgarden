Kelda Preet is a late-middle-aged Dwarven Woman and Lawmaster of Aesend. She took over the position after her husband, Jerakus Preet took off and went to sea to try earn the affection and favour of [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Istishia\|Istishia]].

Kelda is overworked, not paid enough, and stressed up to the eyeballs. Thankfully since the gang managed to nail Alonso Mako for his crimes, she has slightly less crime in the city to be concerned with.

As well as her duties as Lawmaster, she has pledged to keep Beannacht informed about anything she hears regarding the Serpent's Doubt and Jesse, however she has warned him that it will be incredibly dangerous to pursue this.
