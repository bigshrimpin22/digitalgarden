Orvyn Sawyer is a middle-aged Human, father of Dottie, and husband to [[NPCs/Olive Sawyer\|Olive Sawyer]], known as the Hooded man by the people of Estwynn.

In the years since the departure of their daughter, Orvyn and his wife have struggled by. Orvyn has lost a lot of his once domineering stature, no longer a woodcutter, he has taken up hunting, foraging and cultivating the things that live in the woods in order to get by. He travels into a nearby town once a month, the week before the full moon in order to collect supplies for the rough days ahead. He has lost a couple of fingers and an eye to his wife since Dottie has left, and fears the coming of every full moon. He knows that one day he will not be able to contain his wife anymore.

He has begun constructing a secure metal bunker in the cellar underneath the cabin where he lives where his wife can stay every full moon in order to protect herself, her husband, and anyone in the surrounding area.
