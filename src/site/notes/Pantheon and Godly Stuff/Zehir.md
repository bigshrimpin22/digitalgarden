Zehir is the god of betrayal, deceit, and imprisonment, and has been given several titles by [[Kitoah\|Kitoahns]], including The Warden, The Betrayer, and The Serpent. He is the youngest of the four original Gods, and used the God Cleaver to split the world into parts in the Kitoahn creation story.

Zehir is the younger, wilier, more cunning brother of [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Bane\|Bane]]. In his older age, Zehir has taken on a trickster, slightly off-putting, grandfather-ly energy. When he appears to people, he is a hunched over, hobbling old man, with a smattering of long yellowed teeth in a mouth that stretches wider than his face should allow, with tiny gold-rimmed glasses. However, when someone is acting out of line, he has been known to stretch to his full height and drop all genial pretence. He does not like to interact with the other Gods due to them reminding him of his past, however he has some general pleasant conversations and spends time with [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Istishia\|Istishia]] in recent months.

Zehir is the god of deceit, imprisonment and betrayal. In the current day he is the patron god of The Crucible. As there is not much in the way of global conflict or wars on Tarkhat following the War of Ablution, Zehir has found other ways to entertain himself. Since open worship of Zehir is exceedingly rare (though not unheard of), he has begun taking more personal interests in mortal lives, creating pacts with those living in the lower planes. The Betrayer treats his subordinates like they're characters in his very own soap opera. 

Zehir has more Warlocks bound to him than all other gods put together, and frequently puts himself, or Relics he controls in a position to be encountered by people he thinks are likely to strike up a Pact with him.

The Betrayer also holds knowledge deemed to be forbidden by [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Ioun\|Ioun]], imprisoning it from prying eyes and minds that cannot hold it.
