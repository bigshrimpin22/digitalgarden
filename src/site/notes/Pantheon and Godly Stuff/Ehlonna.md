Ehlonna is the goddess of life, nature and growth, and has been given several titles by [[Kitoah\|Kitoahns]], including The Matron, The Mother, The Pale Lady, and Alspr√©ach (Kitoahn for Spark of Life). 

All life has to come from somewhere. On Tarkhat, all life as it currently exists, comes from Ehlonna. As part of the story of creation of the world taught to children in Kitoah, the Gods realised after dividing up the world that there was nothing for them to do with it, so the Matron created life by binding herself to a pillar of stone on the barren landscape, turning it into the first tree. This is also the accepted reason for why the Great Green, and by extension, Kitoah have such a magical tendency

Ehlonna is the oldest and most revered god in the Kitoahn pantheon, as all life springs forth from her. Her name is invoked often and readily by those on the continent, when asking for good fortune, good weather, or merely giving thanks for the fineries in life. In the modern age, the practices of her worship are not as strictly enforced, and reverent worship is usually reserved for those who live closer to nature. 

Literal depictions of her are seldom, as nobody can truly capture the beauty of her original visage, but those who are closer to nature speak of Fey-like features appearing to them in trees. Her symbol, a wide-stretching tree can be seen everywhere if you know where to look, some cities even working her emblem into the very layout of their streets, in order to promote and encourage good fortune and growth.
