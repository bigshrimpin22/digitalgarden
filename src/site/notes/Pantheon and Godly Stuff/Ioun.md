Ioun is the goddess of knowledge, progress, and justice, and has been given the title "The Scholar" by [[Kitoah\|Kitoahns]].

As society developed, the need for education and accretion of knowledge developed too. While formal education is rare in Kitoah, the justice system and laws are overseen by those who follow the teachings of Ioun closely. It is said that as the first towns were forming and crime was beginning to become rampant across them, she appeared to several people across the land with a similar message, and each began to form the laws of the land, which developed into the system of law seen across Kitoah today. 

Sheâ€™s depicted in all forms and races, being seen as an everyman, and showing that anyone can rise through the pursuit of knowledge and truth. She has even been known to intervene in proceedings from time to time, and has the most verifiable appearances out of any of the gods in the cinquain.

Ioun has personally blessed the city of Tithapst as the cradle of historical knowledge, lawkeeping and education in Kitoah.

Despite her open mind and tendency towards forgiveness, Ioun is not a god to be crossed, and when particularly egregious or foul crimes are committed, she has no qualms about personally sending them to The Crucible, much to her chagrin, as she is giving her [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Zehir\|least favourite]] of the gods another plaything.
