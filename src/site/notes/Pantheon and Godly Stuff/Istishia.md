Istishia is the goddess of water, travel, and freedom, and has been given the title of The Maiden by [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoahns]]. 

Istishia is a recent emergence in the pantheon of Kitoah. Originally starting from a splinter of the church of Ehlonna in the last 150 years, she revealed herself for the first time to the port town of Aesend 25 years ago. There are campaigns for her to have more recognition in the other nations of Tarkhat, and King Aegir was more than happy to add her to the continent’s recognised list of deities. Her followers are now widespread, and many have adopted her teachings of freedom from the burdens of life, and freedom to roam the land wherever you want to go. 

Istishia takes the form of a young halfling woman, embodying the race’s reputation to travel and seek new experiences. She’s particularly loved by sailors, who regularly swap stories of seeing her off the side of their vessels, and taller tales of romancing her, seeking her favour to always have good wind in their sails. She has also become a reason, or rather an excuse for several men (and some women) to take off from their families to pursue both her and a sense of freedom on the open sea.

Religious fundamentalists are not very fond of The Maiden, but due to the number of people present at her first appearance, and the number of scholarly verified appearances she has had since then, their denial is of her worthiness of worship, rather than a denial of her existence. They fear that her appearance is a slippery slope that could eventually lead to gods becoming meaningless and holding no power

Istishia herself is still getting a handle on being a god, and enjoys conversing with her elder fellows. She appreciates [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Zehir\|Zehir]] and tolerates him on a level that the others do not, understanding that by his existence, freedom as a concept is more valuable, and is more willing to entertain conversation with him as a result.
