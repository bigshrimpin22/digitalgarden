Bane is the god of war, conflict, and performance, and has been given the title of "The Shield" by [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoahns]]. 

Within the recognise pantheon, Bane is the second-most venerated God in Kitoah. As life evolved, it engaged in conflict, it began as necessity, but now is more out of emotional fulfilment. Kitoah has not seen a major war in a millennium, and Baneâ€™s purpose has moved from that of a fierce and overwhelming combatant to that of a stalwart protector, and source of bravery for those engaged in bouts, or the performing arts. This can be best seen in the popular wrestling tradition that has small pockets in every city, but has the crux of its industry located in Sandurug. 

As the second oldest god, Bane has become a little more aged, depictions of his likeness showing a grizzled, still muscular, older dwarven man. Many modern depictions show him engaging with some form of art, whether sculpting a weapon for himself from clay, or laughing uproariously at a play. Many theatre companies will leave a balcony booth empty on their opening night, in case their patron wishes to make an appearance to bless them.

A great many paladins both in Kitoah and beyond will make a solemn prayer and declaration to Bane as part of their Oath, seeing him as the perfect example of a powerful warrior who knows when to use force, and when to use diplomacy.

While Bane does not show himself often in the mortal realm, those who seek his blessing often receive their confirmation from him in the form of a crack of thunder with no accompanying lightning to be seen. In earlier times, this was seen as the sound of him beating on his shield with the hilt of a weapon, but has evolved with the times, and now is seen as him joining a chalice in toast, or approvingly slapping the arm of a chair where he is seated to watch the show.

Bane has a much higher tolerance for his brother [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Zehir\|Zehir]] than the others, and on several occasions has been the only thing stopping him from being ousted from godly power entirely.
