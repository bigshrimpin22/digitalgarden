The document reads:
"On this day, as the light of our Mother heals us all; as the arm of our Father lifts and guards us; as the eye of the Scribe watches over all; as the chains of the Serpent are broken, We, the people of a free and just kingdom adamantly affirm our right to governance, independence, and freedom from oppression and control of foreign bodies.
The newly anointed kingdom of Free Kitoah, will no longer be covered by the shadow of our elder sibling continents. We have stepped into the sun. With this document, with this pen, with these words, I bind my soul to this land. As long as my blood still flows in this blessed kingdom, no blade, no stone, no barrage will harm our people. This I swear to the great treasure of my life, the people of Kitoah. Remember not my name, erect no statues of my visage. Stand for your fellow Kitoahns. A people united will never fall.
