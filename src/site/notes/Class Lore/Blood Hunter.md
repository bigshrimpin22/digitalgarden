Blood Hunters are those who have dedicated their life to hunting down and eradicating evil in the world as they define it. Blood Hunters are typically born with some form of sorcerous ability and undertake a form of [[ETC/Pact\|Pact]] with themselves.

This Pact is sealed through a ritual known as the Hunter's Bane, in which the Blood Hunter catalyses their own blood to act as fuel for their magic. When using their abilities, hunters use their own blood as opposed to material components, as a more extreme form of the typical exhaustion that comes about from using magic. 

The Hunter's Bane can have unintentional side effects if the person's intent is impure when undertaking it. Lycan Hunters can be left permanently disfigured and animalistic, becoming more like the beasts they seek to destroy. Ghostslayers can become detached and absent, losing their grip on their own form and reality itself. Profane Souls can come back "wrong". It is incredibly risky for someone with second thoughts to undertake the Hunter's Bane, which is why Blood Hunters are not common.

However, once the initial ritual has been complete, the Hunter essentially becomes a perpetual motion machine. As long as they have enough rest to restore their blood, they don't require the upkeep and sacrifice of a [[Class Lore/Paladin\|Paladin's]] Oath, or the regular repayments of a [[Class Lore/Warlock\|Warlock's]] Pact.

Blood hunters sometimes come together with like-minded individuals and form Orders, although this isn't as common as it is among Paladins, due to the differences in opinion that can arise when striving for the same goal
