Sorcerers are those born with a natural ability to control magic. Sorcerers have been born at every point throughout the history of Tarkhat, however there is a vastly higher percentage of Human-born sorcerers compared to any other race. 

This inclination stretches to races that have human lineage such as Tieflings, Genasi, Drow, etc. This is due to Human's native status in [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah]], which gives them several generations worth of exposure to the higher level of inert magic in and around the continent.

Sorcery typically manifests itself as bursts and eruptions of Wild Magic, emerging in children and adolescents, varying in severity from unnoticeable to potentially life threatening to anyone in proximity to the Sorcerer. This can be ameliorated by medical treatment, or in rarer cases, teaching the child to harness their Sorcery, which is typically exclusive to richer families who can afford to send their children to [[Locations/The Spindle\|The Spindle]]. However there are several cases of children leaving their homes behind to willingly train under elusive magic experts, or even Hags, to varying degrees of success.

Examples or Sorcerers:
