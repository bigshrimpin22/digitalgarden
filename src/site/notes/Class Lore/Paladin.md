A Paladin is a spellcaster who gains their Magical abilities from their [[ETC/Pact\|Oath]]. Most Paladins are a member of an Order, a formal organisation comprising of multiple Paladins who swear the same Oath. Examples of Paladin orders include:

[[NPCs/The Wonderous Travelling Brotherhood of Bane's Combatants\|The Wonderous Travelling Brotherhood of Bane's Combatants]]
Iron Cliffs Coast Guard
Paladins of Pha'arma

Paladin status is not entirely dependant on membership of an Order, however. Paladins of Vengeance typically tend to act alone, and [[Player Characters/Vanston Chixtabar\|Vanston Chixtabar]], the most famous hero in recent Kitoahn history is probably the most notable example of a Paladin acting outside of the confines of an order. Examples of other Paladins who act without a formal Order membership include:
- Enzo Ferratus
- Enz0
- Aegir von Stamros
- Charles Faurnbrow (Following the destruction of the Iron Cliffs Coast Guard)
