Barbarians are people who are able to channel the energy of intense emotions into physical power. Many barbarians exhibit inhuman and otherworldly feats of strength, speed, and stamina when channelling these emotions through a state known as Rage. The emotions channelled need not be negative, as some barbarians enter a state of manic laughter or religious euphoria when raging. 

In the case of some barbarians, their Rage is so intense that it can tap into the Weave, giving them the ability to exact some form of influence over the world through magical arts (with varying levels of intent, e.g. Wild Magic), or altering the very shape of their body.

Examples of Barbarians:
