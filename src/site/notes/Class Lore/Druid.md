Druids are spellcasters who are closely in tune with nature and draw their ability from their connection to it. Although it is not entirely confirmed, many scholars of magic believe that [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Ehlonna\|Ehlonna]]herself is the direct source of all Druidic magic, although this belief is quite uncommon outside of [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah]]

The druidic arts aren't as common as they once were in Kitoah, with the burning of the Great Green (see: [[ETC/The Conflagration\|The Conflagration]]) leading to a strong decline in the influence of the Feywild in the kingdom in general. Despite this, communities that practice Druidic worship of nature and The Matron are still more common in Kitoah than they are anywhere else on [[Locations/Tarkhat\|Tarkhat]]

Examples of Druids:
Ehla
