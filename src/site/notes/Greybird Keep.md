Greybird Keep is a small town in the mid-east of Kitoah 1000 years before the beginning of the main campaign, and is the starting location of the Online campaign. It is mainly a farming town, with the residents working the plains nearby, but it also stands right on the outskirts of the Great Green, the forest that covers most of the eastern half of the kingdom. Some of the residents work as lumberjacks in the woods, although they are wary not to stray too far from the edge, as there are many stories of people going missing in the woods, or coming back changed, touched by the Fey.

The population of the town is about 200-300. There is no official mayor, people typically refer to the Chairperson of the Farmer's Guild Grigor Edmond as the go-to point of authority, and their judgement is usually trusted. That's not to say their authority is needed often, all being said, Greybird Keep is an idyllic little town.

In recent time, there has been a lot more military movement around and through the town, to the dismay and outrage of the residents. Many of the men in the town have taken up arms in protest, and stopped all military passage through the town on several occasions. It has very rarely come to blows, but a couple of months before the start of the campaign there was a skirmish with a Silcarian legion which resulted in the death of two residents, as well as the grave injuring of Wulfric Grimward.
