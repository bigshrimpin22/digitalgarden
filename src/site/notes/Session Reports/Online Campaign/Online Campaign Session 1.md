The party are classmates from Greybird Keep and had just finished their classes for the harvest season. While talking to each other outside their school, they noticed the sound of marching troops, watching in awe as a Scilcarian parade passes through the town, drawing worried looks and remarks from other villagers

The party consists of Lira Goodhart, Enzo Ferratus, Elias Kullervo, Vara Anunsiá, and Cassian Grimward. After leaving school they made an agreement to meet outside the local tavern, The Tawny Beard for the harvest festival dance, and all go home to their parents/guardians.

At the dance, they saw one of their classmates, Isadora Dalton, crying because her dog (Butternut) had gone missing and she couldn’t find him anywhere. She said that the hole in the fence at the bottom of her garden led into the woods but she’s too scared to go herself

After creating and traversing a narrow bridge over a stream, they came across a clearing in the woods where they encountered a young acolyte attempting to raise a skeleton from the dead, while Butternut gnaws on its leg. The Acolyte had been sneaking the skeleton through the woods and realised he couldn’t shoo away the dog. 

The kids snuck up to the door and attempted to charm their way into understanding the situation, eventually breaking down the door and starting a battle with the acolyte.

After the fight, several books were found on the acolyte, which the kids shared among themselves. The kids dragged the unconscious acolyte back to the town, handing him over to Grigor Edmund, and returning Butternut to Isadora. Grigor Edmund showed great concern at the existence of these books. Most of them ended up being returned to him by the parents and children, but some stayed in circulation among the group, of particular interest to Elias and Vara.

End of Session Rolls (1 year):
- Vara's father falls deathly ill, being tended to by Crevice and the local holy people. After he falls ill, she begins to realise that she is no longer finding dead animals around her. In his sleep, her father mutters constantly at a level that can barely be understood
-  Cassian heads into the great green with his brother and some older boys trying to find some good locations to ambush enemy militaries. After some time, he finds himself lost and comes across a skeleton in a suit of armour, bearing the insignia of Bane on his chest, and a morningstar with an amber glow. Upon picking it up, he sees a vision of Bane himself, who stoops down to him, places a hand on his shoulder, and tells him he must not lead a life of battle, he is fit for so much more than death in a field of monsters, he must not follow his father and brother. Upon returning home, his mother can tell something is wrong, and tries to comfort him
- The Old Man from the woods begins showing up in every reflective surface Elias looks at. Any person he sees in a mirror appears ancient, wizened and decrepit, getting older and older and older until one day, his mother doesn't show up in mirrors anymore, instead being replaced by the old man. 
- Enzo is told by his father that the bracer allows the user to not only bring the dead back to life, but to allow them to maintain any memories that they had after dying.
- While hanging around the house the following month, moving things to a carriage outside to go home for the summer, Lira knocks a box to the ground, scattering documents everywhere. Reading through them as he collects them, Lira sees that his father has been funding all three prongs of the conflict currently unfolding, selling and buying weapons and supplies, making a pretty penny while he does so
