The party got on board the self-piloting ship, and made their way out into open sea, exploring the ship to find a hastily fled party room, and a young Loxodon boy, Edmer, hiding in a barrel, telling the party of how his family and friends who he had been travelling with had been pulled from the ship by grasping tentacles. He also informs them that Alonso Mako was the one to offer them this complimentary trip of the bay aboard the Ocean Experience trip.

Suddenly, the Paladins of Pha'arma teleported aboard to apprehend Charles. Ehla resolved to stay with Edmer and protect him while the others accosted the paladins and attempted to negotiate. Not taking no for an answer, it came down to combat. Through a tough battle, the party managed to defeat them, including Mion teleporting the Monk with his Transporter Stone to an unknown location, returning alone some time later.

The battle ended with The Matron herself seemingly imbuing Charles's final blow with a spark of her own power, leading the leader of the paladins to be completely obliterated. The final armoured figure managed to get away.

Following the battle, the party noticed that the ship was starting to turn back towards land, heading towards a cliff face and a seeming cave, ending the session here.

Note: at the end of this session, the party levelled up from Level 3 to Level 5.
