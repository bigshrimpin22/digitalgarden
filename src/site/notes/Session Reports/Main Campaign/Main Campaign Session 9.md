Note: Gelifraction Wedging has joined the campaign, played by Miney
Mion was confronted by the Scilcarian legion in a tavern in Aegirstead before making his way to Estwynn to meet up with the party again. After encountering them he is filled in on the information they have collected about the Hooded Man

The party are in the town following their investigation. Geli is in town to meet with Jowos Doublet in order to retrieve and destroy forbidden information. After asking the party for directions, they lead her to his office for a hefty sum of 20 gold. Geli takes the pages in question that Jowos retrieved from a client he was representing in court, and burns away the forbidden information from the pages before anyone (including herself) manages to read whats on them. Chud proceeds to destroy the rest of the paper.

After harassing Jowos a little more, the gang heads back outside and starts making a plan for their ambush they plan to catch the Hooded Man. Geli, Dottie, and Chud head into the woods looking for any trace of his existence, which results in Chud harassing a young woman in her home multiple times and not much else. Beann plans to watch everything from afar on top of the tower attached to the theatre, while Charles scopes out the path into town from the woods for a good place to watch from. During this, Mion heads to the winery, enjoying a fine drink and offering to sort the bottles in the back of the building which he completes successfully. At the same time, he manages to set up some traps beneath the windows, so if any poor soul attempts to enter the building by window they will be severely injured.

Eventually the plan is prepared. Mion and Beann wait in town to see where the Hooded Man decides to go, Charles, Chud, Dottie and Geli wait in the woods to follow him from afar, and attempt to see where he came from. After a while he shows up, and the wood team attempt to follow him quietly, failing in the process, causing him to speed up. Eventually he breaks through the treeline heading towards town. Dottie follows him and makes a massive noise, causing him to turn and see her.

The Hooded Man sprints towards Dottie, wrapping his arms around her and pulling her into a hug, being revealed to be Orvyn, her father. Stunned, the forest group reconvenes, and Beann heads down towards them. Orvyn reveals to Dottie that he and her mother Olive have been living in the woods near the town for a few years now, and that Olive's condition has been getting much worse. He has been stealing materials to rebuild the house they live in following Olive's latest turning, and Orvyn is heavily scarred. 

Dottie decides she wants to go see her mother, and separates from the party, heading deep into the woods following her father, revealing that she now works for the king and is trying to get money to them. When they reach the home, Olive is sat chained to the wall in bed, gaunt and scrawny, barely able to speak or move until prompted to by Dottie. She is desperate for anything that can help with her condition, and Dottie promises to do whatever she can to find something to fix it. She hands over all her money to Orvyn to tide them over until the money from the king gets to them as she leaves and regroups with the party.

The party decide it is time to notify the Lawmaster that the case has been closed, and pile into his office, with Lideer finishing some work for the evening as they do. Despite their best efforts, they are unable to convince him that the problem has been dealt with, and even raise suspicion in the Lawmaster. Before they can muster up a convincing argument, the Lawmaster disappears from the room, leaving the party locked inside, forcing them to grapple with their now dubious circumstances as the session comes to a close
