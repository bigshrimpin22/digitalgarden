In the late evening, Beannacht swapped out his armour for studded leather at a local blacksmith. The party reconvened with [[The Wonderous Travelling Brotherhood of Bane's Combatants\|The Wonderous Travelling Brotherhood of Bane's Combatants]], and hit the town with them, sharing several drinks at a tavern and getting pretty drunk. Charles enters the town, quite grief-stricken and unsure of himself. Walking past the tavern he spots the group inside, and they encourage him to seek out [[Aegir von Stamros\|Aegir von Stamros]] and talk with him. 

Charles does so, and discussed the concept of Oaths with the King, who imparts the knowledge that his type of personality could be better served working under the sight of [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Bane\|Bane]], the Shield, or The Father as Aegir refers to him as. He advises Charles to visit the Church of the Father to seek their guidance. He discussed the oath that he shared with Ehlonna, and received some holy texts about Bane, and how his paladins spread the word and help others in his name. He gives Charles the names Taneke Deep, Trost Brunley, and Winston Smiggle as names to ask for in the temple.

Following their meeting, the party leaves the tavern for the night, with Chud failing to woo Fulfhea the Wolf. Beann eyes up a young man dancing, and successfully flirts with him, and they go back to Beann's room together.

Waking up the next day the party prepare to leave, noticing that Mion is missing from the group, but receiving a note saying he will join them eventually. Charles visits the Church of the Father, and gets advice and holy texts from Taneke Deep about how he can become a Paladin that embodies the promise of Bane.

The party travels towards Estwynn and meets an Old Man on the road after their wagon breaks down. He asks their names and they freak the fuck out for literally no reason and eventually he fixes their wheel and they leave.

Arriving in Estwynn the party begin to look for the Lawmaster, Woodwyn Lideer, eventually finding him at the local Theatre, where they are preparing to stage a play written by one of the local kids about the war for Kitoah's independence. Woodwyn Lideer informs them of the strange burglaries that have been occurring in recent times, and advises them to speak to local business owners. Beannacht reads some Thieve's Cant on the side of the theatre, bemoaning the accuracy of the play saying it's a bunch of crap

The party speaks to:
Elmo - Arachne tailor
Jaude Pontrey - Apothecary
Lefou Delacarte - Antique Store
Whose stores have all been robbed recently

In recent months, strange burglaries have been occurring, farmers, merchants and shopkeepers have had their stores and shops broken into, not violently, and small amounts only. Food is primarily being stolen, but other things include metalworking tools, herbs and healing potions, medicinal supplies, and even rolls of fabric and bedding.

Children in the town have been scaring each other with stories of the "Hooded Man", who limps silently into town once a month in the early morning, and makes wordless purchases from some of the merchants. The Hooded Man has been spotted in town multiple times in the last few months, and some of the kids are nervous at his uptick in activity

After interviewing each of the store owners, the party resolves to lie in wait and ambush the Hooded Man upon his next appearance in the town
