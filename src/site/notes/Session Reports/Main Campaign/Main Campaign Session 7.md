Note: Ehla and Charles were DMPCs for this session as Rena and Gavin were absent

The party, on their last day before heading back into town are abandoned for a while by Cahrles, and ambushed by a group of bandits who are rifling through their camp for gold, magical items, and anything they can use to help the lead bandit, Alistair's sister with her Wild Magic affliction that she got after stepping through a fae circle

After almost killing Alistair, Mion managed to convince them to hear him out and informed them of his connection to Turkish Quandale, a famed physician in the kingdom. The party met with them in Aegirstead the next morning, and Mion passes them the information they need to find Quandale

Before meeting with the King, Jakob takes a moment to examine both Chud and Ehla, before allowing them to pass into the main chambers. Aegir greeted them each by shaking their hands, offering them a meal. He commented on the fact that Vanston Chixtabar is off everyone's radar and hasn't been seen in a long time. He discussed how his ancestor, a man named Calvadas bound his soul to the kingdom of Kitoah and that now keeps it safe from foreign intrusion. The room has the original Calvadas Treaty present above the mantle. Aegir also comments on his desire to meet with Charles Faurnbrow, expressing his admiration for the Iron Cliffs Coast Guard and understanding of the unique trials and stresses that face one who has taken on an Oath. 

The party when asking for their rewards requests:
- Dottie: Money to be sent to Hildebald Bigge, and to her parents (if they can be found)
- Chud: Infrastructure and money to be put into his village, a stronger link between the mainland and the town
- Mion: Three favours, and payment for Alistair and his sister's fees after visiting Turkish Quandale
- Beannacht: Access to armaments and any and all further information regarding the location of the Serpent's Doubt

Beann was also handed a bag containing a sending stone that allows him to communicate back and forth with Kelda Preet of Aesend

The king informed the party of other things in the kingdom that need to be taken care of, a strange string of burglaries in a small town to the east of the capital, as well as a request for some security detail in Sanrdurug out west. He also mentions some rumblings of criminal happenings in some smaller island nations, but nothing people can act on currently. The party decided to take on the assignment out east, with further details to be shared with them in the coming days. The king also gave each of them 80 gold, and a chance to enjoy spending time in the capital over the coming days.

Beannacht was led to an armoury within the palace where he meets with Elma Stonecrest, a half-orc woman who provided him with a grappling hook and some scale armour.

The party goes on to do some exploring and shopping in town. Dottie gets another daisy for herself, after giving her original one to Ehla. Chud also purchases some strange boots from an antique shop, run by a small bullywug. Chud and Dottie also encountered The Wonderous Travelling Brotherhood of Bane's Combatants, where Dottie reunites with Fulfhea the Wolf, introducing her to Chud. Fulfhea offers them the opportunity to perform in a couple of shows which they gladly accept.

Upon further wandering, the party encountered Daegan Moriarty, a friendly tiefling man who painted pictures for Beannacht, Dottie and Chud.

A Yuan-Ti of high standing is led through the crowd by guards towards the palace, locking eyes with Mion as he passes the group
