Beann and Dottie encountered Chud and Ehla in the bar they attend to watch the Snail Wrestling match. Both Chud and Ehla had entered snails in the fight, Ehla with her snail Natty B, and Chud with Kelp. After betting on the game with Ricky Pianos, a short human man who is the ringleader, it is revealed that there are other entrants into the match, Luke Kalaylee who owns the face snail, Shelldon, Vivian Cillitude, handler of the heel snail, Hell's Shell's, as well as a mysterious figure in a cloak Khargle Festle, who tries to enter his "Snail" (small human man) into the fight. He was turned away.

After an arduous battle, Natty B was crowned the victor of the snails. Later that night, three heavily armoured figures appeared, seeking to take Charles into custody as they believed The Grey Sloughing is incubating within him. These assailants were actually part of the Paladins of Pha'arma, an offshoot of worshippers of the Matron who believe in the propagation of medicine for personal and financial gain. They sought to contain Charles, presumably for profit, and to eventually create a cure using his blood. They gave him until the next day to turn himself in. 

Charles and the rest of the party were entirely nonplussed, deciding to try and get as far away from the town as possible so as to escape the paladins chasing them. They resolved to find a way the next day.

The next morning, the party travelled back to the Maiden's Museum to confront Alonso Mako. In a shocking and completely unexpected turn, they decided to send themselves on what appeared to be a suicide mission, on the Ocean Experience trip around the bay of Aesend, the trip that so many people had disappeared on in recent times.

The party also encountered Cashel Calven, a Firbolg with a caravan shop set up in the central square of the town.
