The party enters a cave in the cliffs next to Aesend on board the Ocean Experience. In the dim light of the cave, they see several globs of greyish-blackish goop on the wall with various people and bones sticking out of them. As they reach the furthest point in the cave that can be traversed by boat, Beannacht notices a sword next to one of the globs. He takes it, and is taken to an extradimensional space where he meets with a mysterious, godlike who offers him the power and chance to eventually encounter and kill Jesse. Beannacht takes the offer, becoming a Warlock of the Old Man.

The party, realising they have to leave the boat decide to tie rope to it and walk further into the cave while holding on to it, so they can be notified if it leaves without them. They also instruct Edmer to stay on the boat as it is safer there (they assume).

Moving further into the cave, they come into a large cathedral, with a pool of water covered in a layer of the slime that has been coating the bay. There is also a narrow ridge of rock that leads up either side of the pool to a narrow passageway that has been cut deeper into the cave. Eventually, the water starts to be disturbed, and the party comes face to face with their first boss fight, The Harbour Scourge. 

After a tough battle they manage to best it, with Mion dealing the killing blow by throwing a dagger through the gaping hole left after its eye was destroyed, and piercing its brain. As the water in the cavern was rising throughout the fight, and they have no way to get back to the boat, the party run for the hewn passageway, to the door that was locked throughout the fight, but is now magically unlocked. they find themselves in a basement of sorts, and a nearby chest (that turns out to be a mimic) gives them their first magical items of the campaign.

After sharing and swapping some of the items, the party hears the door to the basement open, and Alonso Mako enters, shocked to see the party there, ending the session.
