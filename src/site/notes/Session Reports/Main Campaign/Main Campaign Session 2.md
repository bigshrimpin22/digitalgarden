The party, while heading to Aesend encounters [[The Wonderous Travelling Brotherhood of Bane's Combatants\|The Wonderous Travelling Brotherhood of Bane's Combatants]], camping out for the night. Making a friendly wager, Dottie bests Fulfhea the Wolf in a wrestling match, and the two confide in each other about their similar capabilities. Charles diagnoses Graal, the Magnificent with cystic fibrosis.

On the way into town, they see a monument of stones, each with names and dates carved into it. Beannacht is able to recognise that these are the names of ships and when they sank or were decommissioned. He pulls out a stone that is signed with a "J", and throws it away from the monument in disgust.

Upon reaching the town, the gang meet with Lawmaster Kelda Preet. She informs them that several people and families have gone missing in the town in recent weeks, typically after going out on the water. She advises them to investigate local businessman and sleazebag Alonso Mako, who runs the local Maiden's Museum, as well as the Ocean Experience bay tours.

After going to the museum and attempting to meet up with Mako, but missing him for the evening, the group splits up. Dottie and Beann decide to go to a local tavern to catch a Snail Wrestling match, where as Mion and Charles decide to enjoy a more fancy tavern with higher end drinks and meals. While at the fancy tavern, a package is delivered for Mion, which contains the teleportation device that allows him to return to his people in Scilcar to confer with them. Similarly, Beannacht receives a note from someone informing him of the future whereabouts of a person of interest
