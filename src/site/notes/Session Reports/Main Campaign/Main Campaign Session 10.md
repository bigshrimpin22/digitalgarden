After the party investigates the office, and a failed attempt from Charles to pray to [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Bane\|Bane]] for help, Woodwyn Lideer returns to the building with two companions in tow, casting several spells, and creating a Zone of Truth that affects the entire party save for Beannacht who disguises himself as King Aegir. Lideer grills Dottie on her connection to the Lycanthrope in the woods, and upon learning the entire truth of the situation decides to let the party go, asking Dottie to advise her parents to tie in with him so the town can make things safer both for the residents and the Sawyer family.

As the party return to the Black Masque to drink and celebrate solving the mystery, Mion takes a walk alone around town receiving a message from his black stone:

"People know
People know you are there
We must meet soon
-D"

While taking his walk he notices the elderly man that the other party members encountered in his absence riding through town on a cart. Unfortunately, he fails to track him any further, falling and putting his fist through a shop window, leaving a pitiful sum of gold as an apology.

Kelp escapes from Chud's bag, revealing his true identity as a Grung. Geli detected his thoughts, and was able to conclude that Kelp has been imprisoned in the shell and cast out by Grung society, and is extremely grateful to Chud. While Beann is incredible drunk, [[NPCs/Kelda Preet\|Kelda Preet]] contacts him. The Serpent's Doubt has been spotted by a trade ship, and it's en route to The Briedes, due to land there in 5 days. Their black flag is at full mast, which means death.

The party decides that this must be their next priority. Charles, Beann, Geli, Mion, and Chud head straight for Aesend to prepare to leave on a boat, while Dottie takes one horse to the capital to ask King Aegir to charter a vessel for them. Aegir is reading documents and looking quite stressed, but is happy to help, even taking Dottie deep underground to a secret network of water-filled caves that can expedite her travel to the coastal city, giving her her first glimpse of the colossal city contained within Mount Syolgi.

While travelling the tight caves, Dottie is thrown slightly off course by a sudden rush of water as she approaches the coast, finding herself within the cave where the party fought The Harbour Scourge some time ago. She manages to find her way back to the basement of the Maiden's Museum and exits into the city, finding her way to the harbour and the boat sent for by Aegir.

She is greeted by the enthusiastic warforged Captain Nilivo, the only person convinced by the brief recruitment effort for a crew in Aesend. Within a day, the rest of the party arrive in the city, purchasing several supplies, and with Chud making a short visit home, leaving a note for his mother informing her that he is ok and will still be away for some time, but that there is money from the king coming to Ewertrench.

Beannacht takes time to go see Kelda at her office, thanking her for the information, as she reveals she knows about his past as a pirate, but can't bring herself to care all that much about it anymore

At long last, the party reconvenes aboard their ship, taking to the water and heading into the uncertain future that awaits them
