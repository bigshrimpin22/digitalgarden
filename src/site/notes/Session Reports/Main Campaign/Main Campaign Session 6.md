Note: Ehla is a DMPC for this session, as Rena was missing

Upon seeing Alonso Mako enter the basement the party immediately attempted to accost him, but he used a wall of force to keep them at bay. The party tried to interrogate him through the wall, as he panicked, asking them how they managed to survive, being horrified at the reveal that the party defeated The Harbour Scourge. 

Eventually, Dottie managed to break through the wall and the party rushed Mako, managing to capture him and tie him up. Mion took his amulet, and they hauled him up the stairs of the basement, only to realise they are inside the Maiden's Museum. The party searched the office, finding a notebook containing names, payment details, and dates of people being "sent" on the Ocean Experience cruise. Mako's gold watch, as well as the notebook has the same date on it, approximately half a year before the current date (halfway through the Shield season of last year).

After collecting enough evidence to prove his connection to the disappearances, Mako was dragged by the party to the Lawmaster, who was amazed to see him taken into custody so soon. Looking through the evidence, she expressed both delight at the nabbing of the biggest scumbag in town, and horror at the amount of extra work this will create for her. The party were compensated for their efforts, and Mako put in a cell, deflated at his defeat.

That evening, Beannacht slipped away from the party and goes to The Quick Riposte to have a conversation with Kelda Preet. He asks her about the location of the Serpent's Doubt and it's captain. She advises him to stay far away, and is not keen to give him any information, but after imploring her, she relents, offering to have a sending stone sent to Aegirstead, which she will use to update him about anything she hears regarding the ships location.

That night the party all have frightening dreams.
Beann - Standing on a small island, he sees a light approaching from the horizon. The light turns out to be a ship, ablaze. He hears screaming, cries of pain, before it all goes quiet
Charles - Is back, alone, in the headquarters of the Iron Cliffs Coast Guard, with an unknown entity banging on the door to be let in
Chud - Finds himself standing in the middle of an endless sea, with a storm brewing above him. He raises his arm with his new Javelin in hand, and lightning strikes it, beginning to boil him from the inside
Dottie - Is running through a forest, with broken chains and shackles on her limbs. A hungry pair of eyes watches her from the treeline, chasing her constantly
Mion - While sat upon a throne, his friends and family complimenting him for a job well done, thanking him for saving them, he looks down, seeing a snake wrapped around his wrist, biting down on his hand

The following morning, the party decides to head back to Aegirstead to collect their reward from Aegir von Stamros for the completion of the quest. Chud and Ehla both decide to travel with the party for now, hoping to achieve some favour from the king too.

Travelling back to the capital, they encounter Nathaniel Boneturner, a young boy with a tent in which he holds an Automaton that can play games. He offers an opportunity to win gold by playing against his creation, the only price is some blood, with no further downsides upon losing. Chud is willing to play, but before he does, Charles fires at the seemingly breathing automaton. The boy begins a screaming panic, forcing the party to leave his tent, revealing that the automaton is, at least in part, his father.

In the fading light of dusk with the moon cresting the horizon, Charles feels something shatter in his chest. In rashly attacking a living creature without reason, he has broken his oath with the Matron, and has thus become an Oathbreaker, ending the session.
