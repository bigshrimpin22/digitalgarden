Note: Max is unconscious for this session because Gavin was absent

The surviving members of the party awake in subterranean cells in the Hope's Beacon Sheriff's Office. As the cells raise to a ground level, the party are greeted by the sheriff of Hope's Beacon, who asks which one of them is Eliza, and reads out a note found with Alyssa's clothes, and no Alyssa

"Eliza,
I'm sorry to address this to you, but I can't exactly write a letter to everyone and it feels the most right to put your name on this (plus I'm none too sure how many of us can read and write). I do trust Mr. Graddaly to lead us through this, but I trust you, Max, Maisie and Khaleesi more, but just in case I ~~die~~ don't make it, I would really appreciate it if you guys could take my share of whatever money we get and water to Collins Edge and give it to the girls. (If theres some magical items or anything else, please give it to Miriam because I don't trust the younger girls with that kinda stuff)
I know you think you've done some bad things, but I think you're pretty swell, and I'm glad that I've been getting to know you :) I'll be keeping you in my prayers even though you don't care much for all that.
~~Yours sincerely~~
~~Sincerely~~
~~Lotsa Love~~
~~From~~
Alyssa <3"

The sheriff informs them that they were picked up by one Mr. Rook who spotted them as he was returning from his semi-regular supply run. The Sheriff tells them that they were found by the side of a train track, with several pieces of valuable SDT property on them, and if he were to hand them over, they would likely be disposed of immediately, but he does not feel like doing all the necessary paperwork. He offers the party conditional freedom, asking them to take on some bounty work to improve circumstances for everyday folk in the region, as well as the Sheriff receiving a cut of the bounties they take on as a finder's fee. 

He tells the group that their freedom is ultimately up to Mr. Rook himself, and invites the man inside. Talisman Rook is introduced to the party. A massive, muscular half-orc with milky white eyes, he requests that the party travel the road back to Collin's Edge with him, as roaming gangs of orcs have been hired by the SDT corporation in and around the town to enforce cooperation and obedience from the residents and anyone who enters the city. He feels that travelling with some more capable companions will make things easier for him, and sees it as a payment for him picking them up and bringing them to the safety of Hope's Beacon.

After the party begrudgingly agrees, the sheriff re-enters, and asks them about the names and drawings in Max's book, and about the Colonel. He warns them that Beele's Regiment, the gang that the Colonel was known to run with in the past are ruthless, and it is a bad idea to be on the wrong side of any of its members. He knows the names Keerin Koyle and Agnes Lockrin, but not Mizmasque.

Once an agreement has been reached, the sheriff hands over the first couple of bounties he wants the party to take care of:
- The Jockstow Family
- A Tabaxi hunter

After reading over the bounties, and retrieving their belongings, the party grabs the still-unconscious Max and place him on Talisman's cart, beginning their journey to Collin's Edge.

The week of travel allows the party to grow more accustomed to one another, as Khaleesi manages to cheat more money out of her companions. Maisie studies the fire elemental crystal that she retrieved from the train, and manages to ascertain that it could be used to fuel things other than a train. Upon feeding it to Puff, he goes berserk for a couple of moments, but eventually acclimates to the crystal, unlocking further capabilities and improving his functionality in combat.

Upon approaching the city, the party are stopped at a checkpoint by three thugs, who examine their cargo and mounts, but they successfully talk their way through without appearing too suspicious, and enter one of the few metropolises remaining in Mirriama. Crowded and dusty and dry, with countless posters and banners and billboards emblazoned with pro-work slogans and the ever-present green eye of The Foreman, the object of worship of many of the lower caste of the city. The party beeline for the market, a former warehouse of SDT that is now populated by stalls, tents and tables of people selling everything from anaemic produce and bottles of fresh water, to gems, silver cutlery, and copper piping.

Talisman approaches his regular water guy, obtaining enough to last him the usual period of several weeks at his home, and pulls a favour, getting a days worth of water for all his companions for free. Khaleesi unsuccessfully distorts the value of her gems to a buyer, but is still on track to make 800 gold pieces once she returns to the market the following day. Eliza scopes out a potential place for her to buy some poison, but doesn't currently have the funds to afford it. The party reconvene at the entrance to the market, deciding to look for a place to spend the night, as the session comes to a close
