In a bunker not too far from the town of Hope's Beacon, Colonel Chance Graddaly's motley crew prepared for their train robbery after spending a week underground to shelter from the Razing. After taking care of their assigned tasks for the day, the party enjoyed some free time. Khaleesi, Maisie, and Eliza Clayton played dice, which Khaleesi has been cheating at all week, while Maximilien Gnothril wrote in his journal, and Alyssa said a prayer to [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Ehlonna\|The Matron]]. 

While writing, Max noticed some engravings on the wall and copied them down
- The name "Keerin Koyle" with a drawing of a male tusked face and an eye symbol
- The name "Agnes Lockrin" with a drawing of a larger female face with a square jaw and strong features, with a symbol of an eye within 5 closed chevrons
- The name "Chance Graddaly" with a drawing of a moustachioed face with a pointed nose, and a symbol of 2 stars within 5 closed chevrons
- The name "Mismasque" with a drawing of a simple smiling face and a single closed chevron symbol
He discussed these engravings with Chance who revealed they they are of him and some old friends.

The group discussed how they should approach their accessing of the train, deciding that they would ride up alongside the train and access it from the back, being slightly more difficult to accomplish, but much safer overall. Following this, the group climbed up the ladder and prepared to ride out to the train, as the sun was finally beginning to set. They rode past the town of Hope's Beacon and waited by the train tracks.

Maisie was first to hear the train approaching and noticed that it was using coal as fuel instead of the standard steam engine. The group followed alongside the train and hopped on, only taking minor damage in the process. The back carriage had a very damaged floor, and was almost entirely empty save for a dwarven man in a comfortable chair smoking a pipe avoiding the smoke pouring through the windows. He informed the party that they would very likely need tickets if they want to stay on the train for any period of time.

In the second carriage, the party found a group of passengers huddling around the only open window, avoiding the smoke still pouring in from the other side of the room. Alyssa talked to the kids while Khaleesi lifted two tickets from one of the adults before moving to the next carriage.

The third carriage was filled with passenger's belongings, and the door fastening was very loose, which Maisie repaired before moving on.

The following two carriages were filled by metal tanks full of salt water being transported to the Factory, with two guards at the front of the second one. Khaleesi and Alyssa resolved to trick the guards into following them. After enchanting one of them with Friends, the guards followed them back to the luggage carriage where one of them was immediately put to sleep by Khaleesi, and the other was knocked prone by Max. They were tied up and Max disguised himself as one of the guards before leading the party into the next carriage.

The sixth carriage was a smaller staff area where two guards were sat at a table on break. They immediately caught on that something was afoot and attacked the party, shooting Khaleesi and knocking her unconscious. Eliza, Chance and Poof, Maisie's construct rushed the two guards, and the first was quickly dispatched by Eliza's strikes and the Colonel's shotgun, and the second immediately surrendered after seeing his coworker reduced to a bloody pulp. The party tied him up and moved on after he informed them there would be more trained guards up ahead.

The next carriage was filled with more expensive cargo, before the front one, where two large Goliaths were guarding the most valuable items. Using Crown of Madness, the larger of the two goliaths was forced to rip the door of its hinges and, with some interference from Ratchet and Clank, Max's robot companions, threw out his companion. Puff was caught up in the fray and fell out of the train also. Khaleesi ordered the larger goliath to jump from the train and finish the job, and he did so, leaving the cargo unguarded.

The party raided further items from the stash, and Alyssa helped the Colonel access a large, sleek, locked chest nestled against the wall. Almost as soon as it was cracked open, the Colonel turned his gun on Alyssa, turning her head into a cloud of red mist, before aiming at the party, using his enhanced Thunderclap Shotgun to blast everyone but Eliza off the train. Chance paid his respects to Eliza, admiring her ability to turn some of the buckshot back at him and cutting up his face, and allowed her to take Alyssa's body as a show of good will.

As she prepared to jump from the train, Eliza looked at what the Colonel had taken from the crate, a large glass bottle with a luminous green philtre within that turned from liquid to gas and back again. She took a shot with her revolver at it as she leaped, breaking the top half of the bottle and spilling some of the liquid within, drawing a roar of anger from the Colonel, vowing he would get his revenge as the SDT train disappeared into the night, leaving the living party members unconscious following their fall.
