Note: Vara was not part of the events this session as Miney was absent

Note: There was a short 1-on-1 session where it was revealed that the nature of Elias's pact is an experiment being undertaken by [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Zehir\|Zehir]], where he has plucked the weave of time in order to provide Elias with his power, and is now sitting back to observe what effect this has on his mind, body, and soul.

5 years on from the events of Session 2, we returned to Greybird Keep, a bustling nexus of the relief efforts attempting to renew the forestry in the eastern half of Kitoah following the Conflagration.

Lira Goodhart arrives in the town after five years apart from it, now a young man taking on financial work for his father, and steadily gaining more trust within the family operations, he entered the Tawny Beard, ordering the most expensive drink he could get, and having a short conversation with Isadora Dalton, now the tender of bar after her fathers purchased it from the original owner.

Returning from his work for the day, Cassian spots a Warforged stood amid the crops behind his home, in the spot where he and Enzo used to train. The Warforged introduces himself as Enz0, built by Enzo's father to redeem Enzo's failure on his mission. Cassian is stunned, refusing to accept the fact that Enzo died after leaving for his mission a year ago.

Seeking help, Cassian heads to Elias's house, with Enz0 following close behind. Elias has also been working with the relief effort in order to support himself and his mother due to not receiving any money from his father any longer.

Elias and Cassian resolve to go to Enzo's house to interrogate Arturo about this robot claiming to be his son, bumping into Lira along the way who heard the commotion passing by the Tawny Beard. Upon confronting Arturo, he assures them that in accordance with the decision he and Enzo made before his departure, he created Enz0 with the memories collected by a magic stone above the entrance to the family home. As a result, Enz0 remembers everything up to Enzo's departure for his quest, and nothing after. The gang struggle to grapple with the morality and logistics of Enz0's existence.

As they head back towards the centre of town, they see a suspicious looking man ride up to and wait outside of the Tawny Beard, wearing a heavy black cloak. He is not forthcoming with his intentions and tells them to scram as he is meeting someone. Eventually another man pulls up and the party are told they aren't allowed enter the bar. After a lot of argy bargy and vague threats, the gang are told they can sit in the bar, silently. A curtain has been erected separating the corner table, and several more heavily cloaked figures enter the bar. 

Elias, using Mislead manages to get close to the curtain and listen in on the meeting. He overhears that there is a plan to remove all foreign invaders from the kingdom and protect it for good, but it requires all foreign soldiers to be removed for a period of time. They have the Scilcarians covered, but there is currently a need for a team to strike in the Tal'Eraiean base in the west of the kingdom.

Upon the conclusion of the meeting, the party intercepts the final two attendants outside the bar, demanding to be included in the discussion. After a lot of refusal and denial, after learning that Cassian is the brother of Wulfric Grimward, they dismount their horses and ask the group to join them inside the bar once again, ending the session.

There will not be a large timeskip following this session (details to follow)
