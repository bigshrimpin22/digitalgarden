After searching the woods for Vara, and asking her for help, much to the chagrin of Cassian and Vara both (based reddit atheist vs based youth pastor), Elias freaks it through time for a moment. Once he regains his composure, the group of intrepid young heroes (and Torveldz) travel the dangerous and arduous roads to Sandurug, the obsidian city in the arid sandy expanse of [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah's]] western desert. Slightly to the south of the city stands a large military encampment, currently occupied by the [[Locations/Tal'Eraie\|Tal'Eraiean]] forces invading the continent.

During their travel and while setting up camp, the group are informed of the important figures in the camp, namely Urial Melloleth (Chief Commander of Tal'Eraie Foreign Operations), Adceder Deepshar (Chief of Encampment Operations), and Bel'zikx Kierhelm (Chief Commander of Kitoahn Troops). Escrow informs the part that the troops are well practiced in evacuation drills, and if the order to leave is given by Melloleth, all troops will be on boats in the water within 5 minutes. Through successful reconnaissance by others loyal to Calvadas, the group knows that Generals and other high ranking personnel wear pendants that denote their rank. Each General is aware of the names and identities of all other generals. These general will take shelter in a bunker in the basement of the building should a direct outside attack be detected. Only generals possessing pendants can access this bunker.

The group has 48 hours before Wulfric Grimward will enact his failsafe from within the camp. Escrow stresses to them once again, that everyone in that camp must be out of Kitoah or dead for Calvadas to perform the ritual. They opt to spend the first day staking out areas of the camp and attempting to gain information on the target residents of the camp.

Through their efforts, Lira and Elias spot Melloleth and Deepshar sharing a romantic moment on the balcony of Deepshar's Office, while Enz0 and Cassian spot a scuffle in the training yard resulting in the destruction of one of the Warforged-esque dummies used by the troops. The party learns that morale in the camp is generally good, with Melloleth greeting the guards on watch by name. Cassian also estimates that Bel'zikx manner of conducting the troops and their movements is not befitting of a man of his status.

That evening, under cover of moonlight, the group formulates their plan for the following day:
- Elias will use Mislead to scope out the interior of the building undetected, gaining as much information as he can
- Cassian and Enz0 will approach the front entrance under guise of a salesperson delivering a new Warforged dummy model with enhanced training capabilities, and attempt to get deeper into the camp
- Using the information from the blueprints, Vara will attempt to teleport into one of the offices on the ground floor
- Once his attempt to gather information is completed, Elias and Lira will make their way back to the balconies of the offices, and attempt to forge notes to Deepshar and Melloleth, tricking them both into a room together where they will be occupied for some time
As well as this plan, Cassian wishes to track down Wulfric within the encampment if at all possible.

After an uneasy night of rest, the group departs from the camp, leaving Escrow behind as he must wait on contact from Calvadas, as well as Torveldz to prepare food while they are away. Elias creeps as close to the camp as is reasonable, leaving his body behind and turning invisible, sneaking his way inside and finding several offices, conference rooms, and locked doors, as well as a logbook in the front room filled with names, one of those being Boris Kullervo, as well as one Reila Kullervo, before returning to his body outside and reuniting with Lira.

Taking the cart used to travel to Sandurug, Cassian and Enz0 approach the receiving area and are greeted by a Dragonborn woman who informs them that they weren't expecting a delivery so soon, but is happy to hear that the first training dummy is free, and eagerly leads them to an office where they wait to meet with Adceder Deepshar. He is pleased with the prompt delivery of a free sample, and after testing it himself by attempting to strike Enz0, he is pleased and informs Cassian that he will gladly take it and that someone will bring it to the training ground for them.

As this is unfolding, Vara teleports into one of the offices, happening upon the unfortunate Warbast Snadipper, a gnomish general of the army. Before he can get a word out, Vara kills him immediately with a spell, causing his eyes to burst and blood to pour from them. After hiding his body under the desk, Vara steals his pendant and assumes his appearance, heading out into the hallway, in an attempt to find her way to something of importance.

Simultaneously, Elias and Lira magic their way onto the roof from their vantage point, finding their way into the offices of Deepshar and Melloleth and picking through their desks and mail. They find an unsent letter from Urial intended for Adceder, terminating their romantic engagement as it is inappropriate. Each of them finds mail pertaining to their respective fathers' connections to the Tal'Eraiean military, and they manage to successfully forge notes from the two elves to one another despite a spilling of ink, manufacturing an illicit encounter to keep them occupied. As well as this, they forge a letter to Melloleth, telling him to withdraw all troops immediately and retreat, stamping it with every official seal they can find on the desk

As the meeting concludes between Cassian and Deepshar, Cassian and Enz0 ignore his instructions and make their way to the mess hall and through the back towards the training grounds. Seeing a queue at the medical tent and two hooded figures wearing the pendants of Generals surveying the training, Cassian and Enz0 make their way up to the Generals. 

As this occurs, Vara as Warbast Snadipper bumps into Deepshar. Deepshar converses with her for a short while. Vara acts sickly as Snadipper and Deepshar advises that she take a trip to the medical tent to see Dr. Bowstring, but Vara asks a favour from Deepshar to let her rest in one of the upstairs rooms instead. Deepshar relents, informing Vara that Bel'zikx doesn't use his bedroom or office on the upper floor as he spends all his time with the troops.

With her access to the stairs achieved, Vara scopes out the basement, seeing the bunker as well as various storage rooms of odds and ends. She places a magical trap, so that anyone attempting to enter the bunker will be greeted by a spectral image of Warbast, shouting that the bunker was about to blow up. Vara also discovers a passageway leading from the basement to a secluded dock with boats for generals and higher ranking officers to evacuate in should the need arise.

Cassian engages in a short conversation with the hooded generals as the troops admire their new training dummy in Enz0, as Lira and Elias attempt to get their attention from up on the roof. One of the generals makes it clear that it is forbidden for a civilian to be this far into the camp, and escorts Cassian to an office in the building, revealing himself to be Wulfric Grimward. Wulfric has been deep undercover in the military base for some time now, even undergoing a ritual to show his loyalty that transformed his face into a half-man, half-wolf hybrid. His wish is to detonate the magical items in the bunker beneath the encampment and wipe out every single Tal'Eraiean staff, taking himself with it, as he sees himself beyond saving. Cassian convinces him to try their plan, and if it doesn't pan out within the next hours, Wulfric can enact his failsafe.

Within a few minutes, Cassian, Enz0, and Vara reunite and make their way upstairs with the help of Vara's acquired pendant. Lira and Elias join them as they burst into the royal bedchamber to confront Adceder and Urial. Enz0 places a zone of truth, affecting both elves and himself, and lays out exactly what will happen, if the evacuation order is not given, everyone will be killed, and Enz0 would rather the invaders be redeemed. The terrified and naked Adceder and Urial agree to his terms, allowing themselves to be bound and escorted down to the hidden dock in the basement.

The group concoct a ruse, where by appearing to be Urial, they can convince Bel'zikx to begin the evacuation. After presenting him with the falsified letter, he is shocked that Urial would deliver such news personally, but obeys his order, and blows the whistle commencing the evacuation. 

Below ground, Enz0 shares some words of wisdom with Adceder and Urial as they are placed upon an evacuation boat in the hidden dock, and the party begins a full sweep of the building to ensure no stragglers remain. Vara opens the bunker, accidentally activating her own magical trap, and almost falling victim to the explosive mechanism set up by Wulfric Grimward. After snatching some items for herself and accidentally arming a bomb, she blinks out of there, throwing the bomb into the empty expanse of the desert. After confirming that the only Tal'Eraiean left in the encampment is the body of Warbast Snadipper, the party make their grand escape, and make it back to camp to find Torveldz alone with no sign of Escrow.

As they enjoy their victory, they watch as a warm pink light sweeps across the kingdom, forming a magical dome before dissipating into warm flecks of energy that blankets the land of Kitoah, bringing it under the protection of the [[Calvadas Treaty\|Calvadas Treaty]], and letting the party know that they succeeded in their goal, and ended the War of Ablution.

At the end of the session, each party member rolled twice on this table to see what would await them in the decade before the next session:
1 - Love: You meet or realise your soulmate and form a strong bond with them
2 - Loss: Someone or something that matters greatly to you has been taken, lost or destroyed
3 - Fame: You create, discover, or invent something of great renown, and you become a notable person in Kitoahn history
4 - Fortune: Through some means (scrupulous or unscrupulous as you like), you come into enough money to live a comfortable life and provide one for the next two generations of your family (should you have family)
5 - Toil: You undertake a vocation, paid or unpaid, and devote your life to your calling
6 - Strife: Disease, destitution, famine, or all three take hold of you and your loved ones for the foreseeable future

Elias: Love and Toil
Cassian: Strife and Fame
Enz0: Loss and Fame
