A year after the events of the first session, Vara's father is still in a coma, Cassian has been training as a psi warrior, Enzo has been sparring with Cassian as well as helping Vara with her father, Elias has attempted to gain more of a handle on his powers, and to study the books they found, and Lira has done his best to investigate what his father has been up to.
Lira's information on his father:
- Waldren has been dealing with a member of the Court from Tal'Eraie, as well as the head of the Scilcarian foothold in Kitoah. He has been acquiring magical gemstones from The Osten Straits and selling them to both sides to power their defence and offence.
- Lira's older brother Idmar is in on this business, not to its fullest extent, but he is involved in the accounting process
- Waldren has been concealing his earnings from both outsiders and his family by laundering his money by buying and selling art at inflated prices to various collectors across continents
- The names Tusza Miltsi - Scilcar, Spinel Sedment - Tal'Eraie, Azure Merollo, and Boris Kullervo show up in the notes

Vara received info from Crevice that a portal to the Feywild would be opening in the forest soon, and that Vara should seek the help of the Green Prince rather than pursue the dark path she had been researching in private. Elias also received a note in the book he had kept telling him something important would be happening there. Not wanting to go alone, Vara rounded up the rest of the gang and asked them to come with her.

The final stop for assembling the crew was the Goodhart home. After some trolling, Lira came to join them, and even recruited his butler Torveldz to act as a lookout while they were in the Fey plane. They took the now well-worn path into the woods, and stepped through a circle of strangely located lily pads, entering the Feywild.

They emerged into a forest that was several times larger than the one they had come from, with trees wider than they could have imagined, and stretching off into the sky, giving off glowing warm light from the inside, and moving like they were breathing.

The kids encountered a group of cows marching at a brisk pace towards what would have been home in the real world. After one cow fell and injured himself, the party introduced themselves to their new friend Gomar, and followed him to the town.

Entering the town, the party watched as a group of cows started to perform a dance, eventually recruiting Cassian to join in with them as a participant. By the end, the Green Prince himself was delighted with the performance, inviting the party plus Gomar to join him for a meal.

Joining the Green Prince in what would have been the Tawny Beard in their normal world, the party were greeted with a veritable feast, with Gomar immediately tucking in. The Prince greeted them all warmly, and invited them to enter in a partnership with him, where the party would defend the forests of Kitoah, and the Green Prince would in turn provide them with information and guidance. The party agreed with varying levels of readiness, and the Prince sent them on their way after answering a question for each of them.

Returning to the real world, the party arrived to a forest up in flames, and no Torveldz. A Yuan-Ti abomination barrelled through the treeline, and attacked the group in its frenzy. After warding it off and eventually managing to kill it, the party were intercepted by Cassian's father, who implored his son to bring his friends to safety. After fighting their way through the blaze, the kids reached the safe line of Greybird Keep, watching as a large portion of the forest covering the kingdom burned to the ground. This event would later become known as The Conflagration.

Upon returning to what should have been his house, Lira was instead faced with a smouldering wreck, and Torveldz, who had attempted to find help, only to find the house burned down; an incredibly strange occurrence, seeing as the house was nowhere near the forest.

End of Session Rolls (5 year gap):

Elias: Discovered that the Old man is wearing his face, but isn't necessarily him. Letters from his father are discovered, including the final letter stating that he won't support Elias and Anna anymore
Enzo: Arrived to the cave, was fried by the energy in the air turning in on him as he tried to leave. A bandit killed him but he managed to take the foe down with him
