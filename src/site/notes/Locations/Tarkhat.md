Tarkhat, The Kitoahn word for “Ground”, is the 4th celestial body in a binary star system. There are 5 celestial bodies in the system, three inner planets, known as the Ruby, Opal, and Pearl respectively. The larger of the stars, Anam (literally meaning Light in Kitoahn) has a smaller star, Thirthal orbiting it, farther outside of Tarkhat’s orbit. This gives a curious effect where the middle of every season on Tarkhat is marked by the appearance of Thirthal’s pale pink visage in the sky at all hours. Many people of [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah]] use this as a chance to celebrate and customs are varied both on the continent and across Tarkhat. The largest celebrations in Kitoah take place during the middle week of the Matron, where all three of the planet's moons are visible in the sky, as well as Thirthal. This marks the beginning of the harvest season in many areas

The main bodies of land on Tarkhat are Kitoah, Scilcar, and Tal'Eraie. There are several dozen smaller islands, nations and collectives, including but not limited to: The Osten Straits, The Briedes, Bai'tal, and many others.

Tarkhat has 3 moons, and its seasons are named according to the presence of each moon in the sky. The Matron is the largest of the moons, being named for [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Ehlonna\|Ehlonna]], and in more contemporary times has been referred to as The Maiden to honour [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Istishia\|Istishia]]. The Scholar is named for [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Ioun\|Ioun]], and The Shield is named for [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Bane\|Bane]]. 
A year in total is 211 days.
