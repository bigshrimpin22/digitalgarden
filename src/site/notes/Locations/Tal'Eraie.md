Tal'Eraie is an empire that controls every territory in Reogia, a supercontinent 4-5 times the size of Kitoah. In current time it is being overseen by the Council of Bright following the assassination of Emperor Yalte XIV by [[Player Characters/Regal Gallivant\|Regal Gallivant]].

Tal'Eraie is the end result of a millennia long effort by the Yalte dynasty to consolidate every society and settlement on [[Locations/Tarkhat\|Tarkhat]] under one banner. Whether this is out of arrogance and desire for power, or a grander design for safety and cooperation among the kingdoms depends on who you ask. Regardless of your source however, it is a fact that the Yalte bloodline, which has now been brought to an unexpected and violent end, benefitted greatly from these conquests, with little to no boots-on-the-ground work from them after the reign of Empress Yalte III.

In order of membership, the member states of the Tal'Eraiean empire are:
- Bosbouer, Founder, and home to the Empire's capital city Auran
- Islinghjold
- Nockorhen
- Ochreye
- Skod Straya
- Ufrer

As well as their attempts during the War of Ablution to take over the continent of [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah]], Tal'Eraie managed to successfully gain control of The Briedes approximately 400 years ago. Similar efforts were made in the last century to make claim to The Osten Straits, but it was deemed pointless, as the frigid islands are uninhabitable to anyone who isn't a Frost Giant, and the plan was swiftly abandoned.

Tal'Eraie is now an empire in decline. Their strategy of expanding their reach and taking tithes from the lands they control has led to a stagnating economy, as they have long run out of land on their own continent, and they can no longer afford to fight to establish control over lands across the sea. This, as well as the assassination of the emperor with no heir apparent has led to increased anxiety and emigration from the continent, a problem the Council are ill-equipped and less than eager to begin tackling as they eye their own dwindling fortunes.
