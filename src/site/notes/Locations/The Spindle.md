The Spindle is the only institution of magical study in [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah]]. It is staffed by several teachers and has been headed by [[Player Characters/Bo Cleraft\|Bo Cleraft]] for the last century and a half. As well as regular staff, they communicate regularly with a committee dedicated to the retrieval and disposal of forbidden information.

Tuition to the Spindle is quite expensive, but a number of scholarships are awarded to those who show a great promise for the magical arts. Anyone of any age can enrol, but it is typically children aged 13-15 who begin their studies each year.

Schooling and tuition occurs mainly in one-to-one sessions, but group teaching occurs when covering topics such as Philosophy of Magic, and general History of Kitoah and magic's place in that history.

At any given time, the Spindle has anything from 15-80 students in attendance. Typically schooling will last 4 to 5 years, but some students learn all they can be taught in one year, and some the depth of some students' talents stretches to the 8 or 9 year mark. Many of the most accomplished Wizards and Artificers in the kingdom attended the Spindle, and graduating is practically a golden ticket to a rich and fulfilling career in the magical arts.
