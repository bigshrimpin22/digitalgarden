Death is the only certainty for any living creature in Aldanraeia. Elves age over the course of almost a millennium. Warforged will fall into disrepair and without maintenance will cease function Even an "immortal" creature like a Lich eventually withers away physically, mentally, and spiritually.
When a creature undergoes death, their earthly functions of thinking, feeling, and remembering cease, along with all bodily functions. 
When a spell such as Speak With Dead is cast, the caster is not speaking with the person themselves, but with an Ethereal Spirit that has been granted the person's body and mind as a host.
The essence of the dead person's mind and spirit will pass from the Material Plane into the Ethereal Plane, becoming part of the unthinking, unfeeling, heavy fog that cloaks the majority of the realm.
It is incredibly rare that an actual imprint of a person's soul can stick around after death. Even Ghouls, Ghosts and other spirits that are subject of many tales and fear are shadows of emotion, violence and evil, rather than being emblematic of the person they resemble.
To bring a person back from the dead is to pervert the natural order. The magic required takes a massive toll on both caster and target, and is not guaranteed to function properly when executed. 
The planes demand balance and bringing a person back from the dead results in the death of someone whose name and face is known to the caster of the spell. If a person is brought back from the dead successfully they retain no memories of any form of "Afterlife", as their brain was not functioning and creating memories.
If a person's acts and deeds in life were particularly evil and they exhibited a special capacity for inflicting pain and strife, their soul may be taken to power the Infernal Engines of the Kingdom of Hell.
