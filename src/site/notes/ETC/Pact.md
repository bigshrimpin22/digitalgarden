A pact is a magically binding promise made by a sentient being, typically a [[Class Lore/Blood Hunter\|Blood Hunter]], [[Class Lore/Paladin\|Paladin]], or [[Class Lore/Warlock\|Warlock]]. The promise does not have to be made to another sentient being, as in the case of Calvadas, who bound his soul to the kingdom of [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah]]. 

An Oath is a form of pact, one (usually) officially recognised and managed by an organisation of actors, taken on by Paladins. The main defining difference between an Oath and a Pact is intent. A Pact is typically engaged in with desire for personal gain, whether it be want for power, money, influence, or knowledge, the outcome of a Pact is mutual (if not always equal) gain for both parties. An Oath is undertaken as a PROMISE rather than a DEAL.

The differentiation between a Pact and Oath is one of the main arguments that scholars have for Magic itself possessing a form of will

When a Pact is broken, the effects on the subject depend on the terms of the Pact itself. In most cases, it results in the complete loss of any capabilities, boons, or positive effects gained by partaking in the deal, but quite often has far steeper consequences in the case of Warlocks. Blood Hunters are typically spared from the worst effects of breaking a pact, as their deal is entirely internal, although there are rumours of bloodborne diseases that come about from Blood Hunters who have sullied their pact.

Paladins, however, typically retain a warped, more perverse version of their power, and become Oathbreakers

In summary:
Blood Hunter: Insane upfront risk and cost, barely any upkeep, slight/moderate cost if broken
Paladin: Little upfront cost, moderate/intense upkeep, moderate cost if broken
Warlock: Often no upfront cost, anything from nothing to insane upkeep, potential massive cost if broken
