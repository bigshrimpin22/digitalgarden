A pact is a magically binding promise made by a sentient being, typically a [[ETC/Warlock\|Warlock]] or [[ETC/Paladin\|Paladin]]. The promise does not have to be made to another sentient being. 

An Oath is a form of pact, one (usually) officially recognised and managed by an organisation of actors, taken on by Paladins. The main defining difference between an Oath and a Pact is intent. A Pact is typically engaged in with desire for personal gain, whether it be want for power, money, influence, or knowledge, the outcome of a Pact is mutual (if not always equal) gain for both parties. An Oath is undertaken as a PROMISE rather than a DEAL. This differentiation between a Pact and Oath is one of the main arguments that scholars have for Magic itself possessing a form of will

When a Pact is broken, the effects on the subject depend on the terms of the Pact itself. In most cases, it results in the complete loss of any capabilities, boons, or positive effects gained by partaking in the deal, but quite often has far steeper consequences in the case of Warlocks. Paladins, however, typically retain a warped, more perverse version of their power, and become Oathbreakers.
