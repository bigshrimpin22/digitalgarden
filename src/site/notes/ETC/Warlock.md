A Warlock is a spellcaster who gets their powers from another entity that they have made some form of [[ETC/Pact\|Pact]] with. Becoming a warlock is the easiest way for a person to attain the ability to cast spells, however very few people take on the responsibility of a pact. Pact details can be incredibly precise and strictly dictated, or obfuscated and vague.

As Warlocks are a rarity, people treat them as a novelty, albeit one to be avoided, but many people who take on a pact feel a level of shame about it that they would rather avoid thinking about or discussing.

Examples of Warlocks and patrons:
- Babara Waddell - The Green Prince
- Beannacht - [[Pantheon and Godly Stuff/Zehir\|Zehir]]
- Elias Kullervo - The Old Man
