The Conflagration was an event in the history of [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah]] during the War of Ablution, in which 60%-70% of the total area of forest in the kingdom was destroyed by burning. It is unknown exactly what or who caused the fire, as multiple fires broke out at the same time in different areas, including near Greybird Keep, around the base of Mt. Syolgi and in the bogs to the south of the continent.

This event led to a decline in the latent level of magic in the air of Kitoah, however replacement and repair efforts over the last millennium have been successful in restoring much of the natural flora and fauna.
