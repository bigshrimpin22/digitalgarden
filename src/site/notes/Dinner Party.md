The Dinner Party was an event held at the home of Peitry Destrilus in 990CT. Among the hundreds of guests were several notable characters, each with their individual goals, including:
- [[Player Characters/Babara Waddell\|Babara Waddell]]
- [[Player Characters/Bo Cleraft\|Bo Cleraft]]
- [[Player Characters/Daegan Moriarty\|Daegan Moriarty]]
- [[Player Characters/Lyla Lyre\|Lyla Lyre]]
- [[Player Characters/Qiyax's Eberoth\|Qiyax's Eberoth]]
- [[Player Characters/Regal Gallivant\|Regal Gallivant]]
- [[Player Characters/Vanston Chixtabar\|Vanston Chixtabar]]

Peitry hosted this event in the hopes that it would legitimise his business dealings. For a few decades he had been growing and solidifying his hold on the criminal underworld in [[Locations/Kitoah\|Kitoah]], and having finally reached a point of saturation, decided to make his debut as a Gatsby-like figure.
Unfortunately, his ego got the best of him, and he ended up inviting people just as, if not more ambitious than himself.

Daegan Moriarty, a talented scammer and artist managed to secure an invite through his own connections, disguising himself as the kingdom's golden boy, Vanston Chixtabar in order to get where the valuables are. Peitry, however, was aware of the presence of Moriarty in disguise and planned to rid the world of him once and for all, as Moriarty had scammed Peitry several years ago. Peitry made sure the fake painting Moriarty had tricked him with was front and centre during the party, as some sort of grim statement piece.

The actual Vanston Chixtabar was in attendance, also in disguise. He was personally invited by Peitry, but also advised that someone would be there to make an attempt on his life. Before entering the party, he disguised himself as Basil Bortram, a high-ranking Tortle of the [[Locations/Tal'Eraie\|Tal'Eraiean]] military. Wanting to face any threat to his life head on, he opted to keep an eye on the crowd, hoping to best yet another threat.

The person who posed a threat to Vanston's life was talented assassin, Regal Gallivant. Fresh off a completed contract from The Red Right Hand that resulted in the end of the Yalte line of emperors in Tal'Eraie, she was now taking a personal contract from an incredibly wealthy party, who asked her to dispose of Vanston Chixtabar.

Qiyax's Eberoth, the head of Emperor Yalte's personal guard arrived outside demanding to enter the festivities, as the brand he managed to attach to the assassin had led him across the sea to House Destrilus in Kitoah, closely followed by his group of keenly trained guards.
Babara Waddell had been given an invitation by her patron, The Green Prince, and asked to retrieve the Staff of the Feywild, a relic that belonged to him and had been lost long ago.
Bo Cleraft, principal of [[Locations/The Spindle\|The Spindle]] sought funding from Peitry for a new initiative in their school, also prepared to present Mr. Destrilus with some blackmail regarding his criminal enterprise should he be uncooperative.

Finally, Lyla Lyre, a former bodyguard of Peitry had been asked by him to perform at the party, the invite being framed as a means of promoting her new music career following her graduation from Bard college. In fact, Peitry was hoping to take revenge on her for abandoning him, right as his rise to power was getting to its most dangerous point.

At the commencement of the party, the guests gathered in the great hall and enjoyed the music being played by the seemingly enchanted instruments floating upon the stage. After some small talk the dinner call was given and the meal began. Ignoring all possible interesting characters scattered around the hall (except for Bo who chatted with the bartender while getting a drink), Babara Waddell, who was able to see through the disguises of both Vanston and Daegan, disguised herself as Vanston, leading Daegan and Regal to become completely confused. Qiyax's interrogated Regal, but her charisma was enough to convince him to look elsewhere for his quarry. 

As the night continued, the party was led on a tour around the house, which Daegan and Babara snuck away from in attempts to steal their respective items, both getting away with it smoothly. Around the same time, Lyla Lyre's performance began, and although the initial attempt to knock her out failed, she was incapacitated after playing a couple of songs, when she opened a suspicious looking box behind the stage that sprayed her with a sleep spell. 

Following the performance, Vanston was asked by Peitry to become an enforcer for him, being able to achieve great glory and wealth, while still being able to embark on personal quests. Sticking to his oath, Vanston refused the offer. This, paired with the reveal that his personal store of magical items had been pilfered, as well as Lyla Lyre breaking through the stone tomb she had been placed in, caused Peitry to fly into a rage, and he began to attack all those he saw as having done him wrong.

Spells and weapons flew for several rounds through the battle, before Daegan Moriarty used the Deck of Many Things, one of the items he had stolen from Peitry's display cases. He drew two cards, one causing his alignment to change to Good, and another giving him the ability to make one wish. He cried out for everyone to stop fighting, and so it was done. The fighting stopped, the manor continued to blaze as all the guests went home. Regal Gallivant failed to kill Vanston Chixtabar, and was eventually caught and slain by Qiyax's as the night grew darker. Babara returned the Staff of the Feywild to the Green Prince, Bo was unable to secure funding for their new projects, Lyla set out to continue her career, albeit more cautiously, and the notorious con artist Daegan Moriarty began a life of total charity and generosity to his fellow creatures. Peitry was left looking over a ruined home, a ruined reputation, and pretty soon after, a ruined career in criminal enterprise.
